**A wide range of coding problems covering following data structure and algorithms**

**Data Structure**
* LinkedList
* Tree 
* Graph
* Stacks and Queues.
* Heaps
* Arrays
* HashTables.

**Algorithms**
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Binary Search.
* Sorting
* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming

These data structures and algorithms are must do for coding interview
