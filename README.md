A wide range of coding problems covering following data structure and algorithms:

Data Structure
1)LinkedList
2)Tree 
3)Graph
4)Stacks and Queues.
5)Heaps
6)Arrays
7)HashTables.

Algorithms:
1)Breadth First Search
2)Depth First Search
3)Binary Search.
4)Sorting
6)Recursion
7)Dynamic Programming

These data structures and algorithms are must do for coding interview
